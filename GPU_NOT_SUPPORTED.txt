                  GPU FAN CONTROL NOT SUPPORTED
================================================================================

If you're getting "Failed to set fan speed" error, your GPU likely doesn't
support software-based fan control through LibreHardwareMonitor.

================================================================================
WHY THIS HAPPENS
================================================================================

1. GPU MODEL LIMITATION
   • Some GPU models have hardware-locked fan curves
   • Manufacturer disabled software control in firmware
   • Budget/OEM cards often lack this feature

2. LAPTOP GPUs
   • Most laptop GPUs have locked fan control
   • Controlled by laptop manufacturer's EC (Embedded Controller)
   • Fan control tied to system cooling, not just GPU

3. MANUFACTURER RESTRICTIONS
   • Some brands lock fan control to their own software
   • Requires specific tools (MSI Afterburner, EVGA Precision, etc.)

4. BIOS/VBIOS SETTINGS
   • Fan control may be disabled in GPU BIOS
   • Some manufacturers ship with this disabled

================================================================================
HOW TO CHECK IF YOUR GPU SUPPORTS FAN CONTROL
================================================================================

Use the built-in diagnostics:

1. Click "🔍 Diagnostics" button in Settings section
2. Look for "Fan Control Sensors" section
3. If it says "❌ FAN CONTROL NOT SUPPORTED", your GPU doesn't support it

The diagnostic report will show:
✅ What sensors are available
✅ If fan control is possible
✅ Alternative software to try

================================================================================
ALTERNATIVE SOFTWARE (Try these!)

================================================================================
GPU MODELS THAT TYPICALLY DON'T SUPPORT FAN CONTROL
================================================================================

❌ Most Laptop GPUs
   • Integrated cooling with laptop system
   • Controlled by EC firmware

❌ OEM/Prebuilt Desktop GPUs
   • Dell, HP, Lenovo prebuilt PCs
   • Often have locked cards

❌ Some Budget Cards
   • Entry-level models
   • Manufacturer cost-cutting

❌ Certain Brands/Series
   • Some Zotac models
   • Some Palit models
   • Varies by specific model

✅ Usually WORK:
   • High-end gaming cards
   • Enthusiast/overclocking editions
   • Cards from MSI, ASUS ROG, EVGA FTW, Gigabyte AORUS

================================================================================
WHAT YOU CAN STILL DO
================================================================================

Even if fan control doesn't work, this application can still:

✅ Monitor GPU temperature in real-time
✅ Display temperature in system tray
✅ Track fan RPM (if sensor available)
✅ Alert you to high temperatures
✅ Monitor multiple GPUs

Just disable manual/auto fan control and use it as a monitor!

================================================================================
LAPTOP-SPECIFIC SOLUTIONS
================================================================================

For laptops, try:

1. LAPTOP MANUFACTURER SOFTWARE
   • Dell Power Manager
   • HP Omen Command Center
   • Lenovo Vantage
   • ASUS Armoury Crate
   • MSI Dragon Center

2. THROTTLESTOP (Advanced)
   ✅ Download: https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-throttlestop/
   ⚠️ Advanced tool, use carefully

3. LAPTOP FAN CONTROL
   ✅ Download: https://github.com/hirschmann/nbfc
   ⚠️ May not work on all laptops

================================================================================
HARDWARE SOLUTIONS
================================================================================

If software doesn't work:

1. ADJUST CASE FANS
   • Better case airflow helps GPU cooling
   • More case fans = cooler GPU

2. GPU COOLER UPGRADE
   • Aftermarket GPU coolers available
   • Arctic Accelero, Raijintek, etc.
   • Requires technical skills

3. CUSTOM FAN CURVE IN BIOS
   • Some motherboards allow GPU fan control
   • Check BIOS settings

4. UNDERVOLTING
   • Reduce GPU voltage = less heat = less fan needed
   • Use MSI Afterburner or manufacturer software

================================================================================
CHECKING YOUR SPECIFIC GPU
================================================================================

To find out if your GPU model supports fan control:

1. Google: "[Your GPU Model] fan control"
2. Check manufacturer forums
3. Look for reviews mentioning fan control
4. Try MSI Afterburner first (most compatible)

Example searches:
• "RTX 3060 Ti fan control"
• "RX 6700 XT custom fan curve"
• "GTX 1660 software fan control"

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

🥇 BEST: Try MSI Afterburner first
   • Most compatible
   • Works with 90%+ of desktop GPUs
   • Reliable and well-supported

🥈 SECOND: Manufacturer software
   • EVGA Precision for EVGA cards
   • ASUS GPU Tweak for ASUS cards
   • Etc.

🥉 THIRD: This application as monitor-only
   • Still useful for temperature tracking
   • System tray temperature display
   • Multi-GPU monitoring

================================================================================
STILL NEED HELP?
================================================================================

1. Run diagnostics (🔍 Diagnostics button)
2. Copy the report
3. Search online for your GPU model + "fan control"
4. Check if others have same issue
5. Try MSI Afterburner

If MSI Afterburner doesn't work, your GPU likely doesn't support
software fan control at all.
